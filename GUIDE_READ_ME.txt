Hello! Welcome to Delta

If you are reading this, congratulations, you have a brain.
Make sure to edit index.js to replace the OpenAI token with your openai token (https://openai.com)

If you do not have access to openai codex, replace "code-davinci-002" with "text-davinci-002" in modules/ai.js

Run the install.bat, then start.bat to get started!
Enjoy!

(this does not work on a user token, to switch it to user tokens, replace discord.js with 'discord.js-selfbot' and run 'npm remove discord.js && npm i discord.js-selfbot', it will be slow!)

YOU NEED NODEJS INSTALLED ! https://nodejs.org (choose the LTS 14 version)

Prompts should be self explanatory, \n represents a newline, age is the bot's age, etc.
Just try not to get yourself banned from openai by putting racist shit there too much.
